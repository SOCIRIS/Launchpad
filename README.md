## 📊 Section Summary

| Section | Items | Layout | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Services | 7 | 3x3 (7th centered) | ✅ Symmetric |

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Symmetry Principles Applied:
1. **Even Numbers**: Use 2, 4, 6, 8 for perfect grids
2. **Odd with Center**: Use 3, 5, 7 with middle item centered
3. **Responsive Balance**: Maintain visual harmony on all screens
4. **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform gaps between all grid items

### Visual Hierarchy:
- **Level 1**: Section headers with gradient labels
- **Level 2**: Card containers with borders
- **Level 3**: Capability/feature items within cards
- **Level 4**: Supporting text and icons

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Use cases not showing all 8
**Fix**: Updated CSS to ensure 4-column grid at desktop breakpoint

### Issue: Technology section was text-only
**Fix**: Converted to card-based architecture with hover effects

### Issue: Team members not properly centered
**Fix**: Applied grid-column positioning for centered items
